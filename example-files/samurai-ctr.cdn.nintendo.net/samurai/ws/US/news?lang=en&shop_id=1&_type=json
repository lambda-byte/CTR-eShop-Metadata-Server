Here you will be able to control what your child experiences on Nintendo 3DS. Some examples include the ability to:\n\n- Filter out information based on game age ratings;\n- Restrict online interaction with other players;\n- Block access to the internet browser;\n- Prevent purchases of software from Nintendo eShop;\n- Restrict Miiverse access;\nAnd much more.\n\nNintendo's Parental Control system was deemed to offer a remarkable level of protection for children after analysis of both Nintendo 3DS and Wii U Parental Control systems in cooperation with USK, the German Entertainment Software Self-Regulation Body. Nintendo's Parental Control system is of a very high quality and was found to have proved itself in practice.\n\nWith these Parental Controls in place, you and your family can have a safer and more secure experience when enjoying Nintendo 3DS.\n\nNintendo eShop team",
